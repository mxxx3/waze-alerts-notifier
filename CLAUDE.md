# CLAUDE.md

This repository is an Android/Kotlin prototype for Traffic Alerts Notifier, a Waze-adjacent road alert notifier.

## Current Scope

- Package: `com.mg.wazealerts`
- Current app version: `0.9.33` / `versionCode 43`
- Build target: Android SDK 36
- Minimum Android SDK: 26
- Main artifact for release testing: debug APK from `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## Architecture Notes

- `MainActivity` is the operational dashboard for active alerts, navigation, and per-alert mute controls.
- `SettingsActivity` owns appearance, scan radius, refresh cadence, live sources, background monitoring, notification, demo source, alert type, and permission controls.
- `ThemeMode` and `UiPalette` provide System, Light, and Dark rendering for the View-based UI.
- The phone UI intentionally uses compact status chips, grouped control panels, and repeated alert cards rather than large plain settings rows.
- Phone alert cards use a dedicated adjacent direction/distance card on the left; keep it aligned with the alert card height rather than moving arrow/distance back into the alert title row.
- `AlertMonitorService` is a foreground location service and posts alert notifications.
- Android Auto support is notification-only: do not register `MediaBrowserService`, `MediaSessionCompat`, `automotive_app_desc`, or `CarAppService` unless the user explicitly accepts a full Android Auto app surface.
- `AlertMonitorService` posts car-compatible alert notifications with live direction arrow, relative direction, distance, and address; notification taps open the dashboard.
- Android Auto road-alert notifications must not depend on Google Maps notification detection; Waze/Android Auto notification delivery should work whenever monitoring, location, and notification permission are active.
- `AlertsCarAppService` was removed in `0.9.8`; do not reintroduce a `CarAppService`/template entry unless the user accepts the larger Android Auto template pane behavior.
- `AlertMonitorService` refreshes remote alert data on the configured interval with a wider cache radius, then recalculates and saves only visible active alerts on every live location update.
- `AlertMonitorService` distinguishes provider-successful empty refreshes from provider failures. Missing alerts from successful providers expire quickly; failed providers can retain cache briefly.
- Android Auto notification reconciliation should stay capped to one urgent alert notification plus one summary notification, while retaining frequent live direction/distance updates.
- Alert notification state has a persistent ledger in `AlertStore` so cleanup does not depend only on in-memory `notifiedIds`.
- `AlertMonitorService` throttles visible-alert UI broadcasts while moving: alert identity changes still broadcast immediately, but distance-only updates are bucketed narrowly enough to keep phone distance labels smooth.
- Release `0.9.7` shipped the Android Auto media-browser-only entry, per-alert direction arrows, and live distance recalculation between remote alert refreshes.
- Release `0.9.8` shipped the modernized phone UI, configurable movement-cache settings, Android Auto title-level direction/distance display, and full removal of the fallback CarAppService.
- Release `0.9.9` first tried media-playback Android Auto integration; that was rejected because it showed as a player and still used the large pane. Keep the corrected path notification-only.
- Release `0.9.10` removes the Android Auto media-player surface, keeps Android Auto alert delivery notification-only, updates active alert notifications with live direction/distance, and keeps the phone dashboard awake while open.
- Release `0.9.11` smooths countdown/distance UI updates without full-screen rerenders, moves phone arrow/distance into an adjacent same-height card, and posts Android Auto alerts as ongoing navigation-category car notifications independent of Google Maps detection.
- Release `0.9.12` moves the Controls panel (scan radius and refresh cadence sliders) from `MainActivity` to `SettingsActivity`, and fixes Android Auto notification delivery by switching from `CarAppExtender`/`CarNotificationManager` (which require a registered `CarAppService`) to `MessagingStyle` with `CATEGORY_MESSAGE`.
- Release `0.9.21` switches to monkey-patching Waze's own fetch calls: loads `waze.com/live-map/?ll={lat},{lng}` with geolocation granted, injects an interceptor in `onPageFinished` that patches `window.fetch` to forward georss responses to Android, caches the first captured response. No separate HTTP call or navigation needed.
- Release `0.9.20` switches from JS `fetch()` injection to WebView top-level navigation (`loadUrl(georssUrl)` after warmup). Navigation requests send `Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate` instead of `cors`, bypassing XHR-targeted bot protection. Also adds `shouldInterceptRequest` logging to detect any native Waze georss calls during warmup.
- Release `0.9.19` reverts to JS fetch inside WebView but with bare `fetch(url)` — no explicit headers. `Referer` is a forbidden header that the browser rejects when set manually; prior versions were likely triggering that. Same-origin request; cookies included by default.
- Release `0.9.18` switches `WazeWebViewFetcher` from injected JS `fetch()` to direct HTTP with cookies extracted via `CookieManager.getInstance().getCookie("https://www.waze.com")` after warmup; logs cookie availability.
- Release `0.9.17` fixes `WazeWebViewFetcher` cookie timing: debounces `onPageFinished` (800ms after last redirect) and extends JS init wait to 5s so Waze session cookies are fully set before the georss fetch.
- Release `0.9.33` caps Android Auto notification volume to one urgent alert plus one summary while preserving frequent live direction/distance updates. Adds provider-aware stale-alert expiration, single-flight remote refreshes to avoid stale repost races, persistent notification-ledger cleanup, and functional `Mark as read` dismissal for alert notifications.
- Release `0.9.32` rebuilds the Settings → Permissions panel as per-permission rows with green/red status badges and a `Grant` / `Open settings` action per row. Covers `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` (Android 10+), `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (Android 13+), Notification Listener access, `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` (Android 12+ via `AlarmManager.canScheduleExactAlarms()` and `Settings.ACTION_REQUEST_SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`), and battery-optimization whitelist (`PowerManager.isIgnoringBatteryOptimizations` / `ACTION_REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS`). `SettingsActivity.onResume()` re-renders so status badges refresh after the user returns from system settings. Also removes the Demo alert source toggle from the Sources panel; the underlying `DemoAlertProvider` and `AppSettings.demoAlertsEnabled` flag remain (for tests/debug) but are no longer exposed in the UI.
- Release `0.9.31` adds aggressive keep-alive infrastructure: `ServiceWatchdog` schedules an AlarmManager heartbeat that the running service resets on every location update (60 s interval when Android Auto is connected via `androidx.car.app:app` `CarConnection`, 5 min otherwise), so if the service dies the alarm fires `RestartReceiver` and brings the service back; `BootReceiver` restarts monitoring after device boot or app replacement; `WatchdogWorker` (WorkManager periodic 15 min) provides a backup revive path; an `UncaughtExceptionHandler` schedules an AlarmManager restart before the process exits; `onDestroy()` schedules a restart whenever monitoring is still enabled. Adds notification cleanup: `sweepStaleAlertNotifications()` clears orphaned alert notifications on service start, `cancelAlertNotifications()` enumerates `NotificationManager.activeNotifications` filtered by `CHANNEL_ALERTS` instead of relying on the in-memory `notifiedIds` set, and `onDestroy()` always cancels alert notifications so notifications never linger after process kill or when monitoring is stopped. Adds `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`, `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`, and `WAKE_LOCK` permissions, and registers `BootReceiver` and `RestartReceiver` in the manifest.
- Release `0.9.30` fixes "ahead only" filter not applying to Android Auto notifications: `syncAlertNotifications()` in `AlertMonitorService` now filters behind-facing alerts using `bearingDiff <= 75°`, matching the phone UI logic, when navigation is active and `routeFilterEnabled` is set.
- Release `0.9.29` fixes a critical performance bug: `MapsNavigationListener.onNotificationPosted()` fires ~1/sec as Google Maps counts down step distance (100m, 110m, 120m...), each call starting `AlertMonitorService` anew. Each `onStartCommand` registered an additional `FusedLocationProviderClient` callback, so after driving 1 minute with navigation there were 60+ concurrent location callbacks, 60+ parallel Waze WebView fetches, and cascading timeouts. Fixed with an `isRunning` guard in `onStartCommand`: subsequent starts skip `requestLocationUpdates()` silently; `isRunning` resets in `onDestroy`.
- Release `0.9.28` fixes three issues: (1) passed-alert detection was broken — `prevDistances` was updated every location tick (~1s, ~17m step), so the 250m delta never accumulated; replaced with `minDistanceSeen` tracking the closest point seen per alert; pass fires when current distance exceeds minSeen + 200m AND bearing shows alert is behind (>100°); (2) Android Auto notification spam — `showAlert()` was called on every location update; now throttled via `notifFingerprint` (direction arrow + 100m distance bucket), only re-notifying when direction or distance bucket changes; (3) Android Auto shows only alert type — direction/distance now in the sender `Person.name` and `setConversationTitle`, both reliably rendered in Android Auto HUD; also: `updatePassedAlerts()` now receives a broader alert set (up to 50 cached alerts beyond visible radius) so pass detection works even when alert exits the visible window before the threshold is reached.
- Release `0.9.27` fixes two issues: (1) alert cards not disappearing when driving past them without active navigation — `updatePassedAlerts()` now detects passed alerts regardless of `isMapsNavigating` state (bearing guard retained); `displayAlerts()` in `MainActivity` always filters passed alerts, not just during navigation; (2) Android Auto notifications not showing — added `automotive_app_desc.xml` with `<uses name="notification"/>` and corresponding `com.google.android.gms.car.application` meta-data in manifest; added `SEMANTIC_ACTION_MARK_AS_READ` action to `MessagingStyle` notifications (required by Android Auto alongside the reply action).
- Release `0.9.26` fixes two issues: (1) cross-provider duplicate alerts (Waze + TomTom reporting the same incident) — `AlertRepository.deduplicateNearby()` drops same-kind alerts within 200m, keeping the closest/first (Waze preferred); (2) race condition causing ~1-in-6 Waze fetch timeouts — `pendingNaUrl` is set before page load and injected as `window._wazeNaUrl` directly in `onPageFinished` (~800ms before env=il fires), eliminating the race where env=il beat `wazeSetNaUrl()` by a few ms.
- Release `0.9.25` queues the `env=na` georss XHR to fire from the `env=il` load handler (after Waze's init call completes and sets session cookies); `env=na` fired before `env=il` completed was the root cause of 403; adds `shouldInterceptRequest` header logging for both env=il and env=na to diagnose remaining issues; fixes misleading "Timed out" error masking the real 403 from `onFetchError`.
- Release `0.9.24` actively injects an XHR call for the real `env=na` georss URL after warmup (Waze never makes this call on its own); adds `onFetchError` bridge method so non-200 responses fail immediately instead of timing out after 30 s; XHR error/non-200 events now reported via `onFetchError(status, url)`.
- Release `0.9.23` fixes `WazeWebViewFetcher` env=il cache poisoning: the URL is now passed as a second arg to `WazeAndroid.onResult()`; the bridge discards any response where the URL contains `env=il` (Waze's zero-bbox init call that always returns empty data and was being cached as the warmup response).
- Release `0.9.22` adds XHR monkey-patching to `WazeWebViewFetcher` (Waze uses XHR not fetch for georss); fixes warmup URL (plain `waze.com/live-map/` without `?ll=` to avoid redirect); notification tap now opens `MainActivity` instead of Waze navigation (fixes Android Auto delivery); adds default navigation app setting (`AppSettings.navApp`, Google Maps default); removes FlareSolverr UI from `SettingsActivity`.
- Release `0.9.16` replaces FlareSolverr as the default Waze fetch method with a `WazeWebViewFetcher`: a hidden `WebView` that loads `waze.com/live-map/`, waits 2 s for JS cookies to be set, then executes `fetch()` from within the browser context via `evaluateJavascript` + `@JavascriptInterface`; FlareSolverr remains available if a URL is configured. `WazeLiveMapAlertProvider` now takes `Context`; `AlertRepository` exposes `destroy()` which is called from `AlertMonitorService.onDestroy()`.
- Release `0.9.15` adds FlareSolverr session warmup: before the first API call, loads `waze.com/live-map/` via the same session to establish Waze cookies; resets warmup flag on HTML response so the next cycle retries; logs first 300 chars of solution body for diagnosis.
- Release `0.9.14` adds `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` to allow HTTP traffic to the FlareSolverr proxy (Android 9+ blocks cleartext by default).
- Release `0.9.13` adds FlareSolverr proxy support to `WazeLiveMapAlertProvider` to bypass Cloudflare/bot-detection on the Waze Live Map API; fixes Android Auto `MessagingStyle` notifications not appearing by adding a required `RemoteInput` reply action via `NotificationActionReceiver`; adds full error logging to `WazeLiveMapAlertProvider` so Waze fetch failures are visible in the in-app log.
- `MainActivity` keeps the screen awake while the phone dashboard is open.
- `MapsNavigationListener` detects active Google Maps navigation notifications; route alerts are approximated around the live device position because Google Maps does not expose third-party route geometry.
- Alert data is intentionally behind `AlertProvider`.
- `AlertRepository` enriches provider alerts with reverse-geocoded addresses before display.
- `AlertStore` persists the latest visible active alerts, a short-lived wider movement cache, muted alert IDs, and passed alert IDs.
- Movement-cache defaults live in `AppSettings`: 20 minutes, 15 km minimum cache radius, 50 km maximum cache radius, 5x radius expansion, and 24 visible alerts.
- `WazeLiveMapAlertProvider` calls the unofficial Waze Live Map GeoRSS endpoint (`waze.com/live-map/api/georss`) with radius-derived bbox and `na`/`il`/`row` environment selection. Default method is `WazeWebViewFetcher` (hidden WebView, JS fetch with cookies). Optional FlareSolverr proxy via `AppSettings.flareSolverrUrl`. All fetch errors logged via `AppLogger` tag `WazeLiveMap`.
- `OpenStreetMapCameraProvider` calls Overpass API for fixed speed/red-light camera data from OpenStreetMap tags and caps searches at 25 km.
- `TomTomTrafficAlertProvider` calls TomTom Traffic API v5 when a user saves a TomTom API key.
- `DemoAlertProvider` generates local test alerts and is off by default for new installs.

## Waze Integration Boundary

Use official Waze Deep Links for opening Waze/Live Map at an alert location. The user explicitly accepted the permission/terms risk for an experimental Waze Live Map source; keep that provider isolated and fail closed because it can return 403 or change without notice.

The stable production path is the keyed TomTom/HERE provider or another authorized traffic incident source. Waze Live Map and public Overpass are best-effort only.
