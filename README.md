# Traffic Alerts Notifier

Android/Kotlin prototype for nearby road-alert notifications.

Current version: `0.9.33` (`versionCode 43`).

## What works

- Kotlin Android app with dashboard and settings screens.
- User-configurable monitoring, notifications, radius, refresh time, live sources, demo source, and alert-type filters.
- Experimental Waze Live Map alert source using radius-based bounding boxes.
- OpenStreetMap/Overpass fixed-camera source for speed cameras and red-light cameras.
- Optional TomTom Traffic API source for global traffic incidents when an API key is saved.
- Foreground location service for background monitoring.
- Android notification channels for monitoring and road alerts.
- Android Auto support through dynamic car notifications instead of a media-player or template app surface.
- Google Maps navigation notification detection for route-adjacent native alerts around the live device position.
- Alert notification taps open the dashboard; per-alert navigation controls can open Waze for the selected alert location.
- Reverse-geocoded alert addresses in the phone UI, phone notifications, and Android Auto.
- Wide movement cache: while monitoring, the app fetches a larger alert area and only displays currently relevant alerts inside the selected radius.
- Movement cache controls in Settings for cache time, min/max cache radius, radius expansion, and visible alert limit.
- Direction + live distance in a dedicated adjacent phone alert card and dynamic Android Auto alert notifications.
- Android Auto notification volume is capped to one urgent alert plus a summary notification, with live direction and distance still updated frequently.
- Provider-aware stale-alert cleanup: if a provider refresh succeeds and an old alert disappears, it expires quickly instead of lingering for the full movement-cache TTL.
- Notification cleanup is reconciled against a persistent ledger so stale road-alert notifications are cancelled even after process restarts.
- Android Auto `Mark as read` now dismisses the related alert(s) instead of being a no-op.
- Phone dashboard keeps the screen awake while it is open.
- Service watchdog keeps `AlertMonitorService` alive while monitoring is enabled: AlarmManager heartbeat (60 s when Android Auto is connected, 5 min otherwise), WorkManager periodic backup every 15 min, auto-start after device boot, and AlarmManager-based restart on uncaught exceptions or unexpected service destruction.
- Stale alert notifications are swept on service start and on `onDestroy()`, so notifications no longer linger after a process kill or when monitoring is stopped.
- Settings → Permissions panel lists each runtime/special-access permission (Fine location, Background location, Notifications, Notification access, Exact alarms, Unrestricted battery) with a green/red status badge and a `Grant` / `Open settings` button per row.
- Demo alert source toggle removed from Settings; only real providers (Waze Live Map, OpenStreetMap cameras, optional TomTom) are surfaced in the UI.
- Smooth live movement updates: countdown, nearest distance, and per-alert direction/distance labels update without rebuilding the full phone screen.
- Main dashboard for radius, refresh time, active alerts, navigation, and per-alert mute controls.
- Appearance setting with System, Light, and Dark modes.
- Compact modern UI with status chips, grouped controls, and alert cards.

## Alert Sources

The app uses `AlertProvider` as a replaceable source boundary:

- `WazeLiveMapAlertProvider` calls `https://www.waze.com/live-map/api/georss` with the current location, configured radius, and auto-selected `na`, `il`, or `row` environment. It maps Waze police, camera, hazard, accident, jam, and closure reports into app categories.
- `OpenStreetMapCameraProvider` calls Overpass API for fixed camera data tagged as `highway=speed_camera` or `type=enforcement` with `enforcement=maxspeed`, `traffic_signals`, `red_light_camera`, or `average_speed`. It is enabled by default and caps its Overpass search radius at 25 km.
- `TomTomTrafficAlertProvider` calls TomTom Traffic API v5 `incidentDetails` when a TomTom API key is saved in Settings. This is the more stable global source for accidents, jams, closures, roadworks, and hazards.
- `DemoAlertProvider` generates test alerts around the current location. It is off by default for new installs.

Official Waze developer documentation still does not expose a stable public read API for nearby Waze user reports. The Waze Live Map provider is experimental and may return HTTP 403 or change without notice. If it fails, the app keeps running and falls back to other enabled sources. OpenStreetMap camera coverage depends on local mapping quality and represents fixed cameras, not temporary/mobile police traps.

## Build

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

The debug APK is generated at:

```text
app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
```

## Install for local testing

```powershell
adb install -r app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
```

Open the app, grant permissions, and enable background monitoring. On Android 11+ background location may need to be granted from the system app settings screen.

## App Screens

- Main screen: radius slider (crash-safe drag), refresh time slider, active alert list, per-alert `Navigate`, and per-alert `Mute` / `Unmute`.
- **Navigation panel** (auto-shown when Google Maps is navigating): current geocoded address, route step text, nearest alert with distance, bearing direction chip, and "Ahead only" toggle.
- **Log screen** ("Log" button in header): in-app log viewer with Clear / Copy / Export.
- Settings screen: appearance mode, Waze Live Map source, OpenStreetMap cameras, optional TomTom API key, background monitoring, global notifications, demo alert source, alert type switches, and permission/system settings shortcuts.

## Android Auto

The app does not expose an Android Auto launcher, template, or media-player surface. It uses car-compatible alert notifications so Google Maps or Waze can remain the primary Android Auto screen.

The closest urgent road alert is posted as an individual car-compatible notification, while additional nearby alerts are folded into a summary notification. Both are updated from live location data with current arrow, relative direction, and distance. Tapping an alert opens the app dashboard.

Release `0.9.11` keeps the corrected notification-only Android Auto path, posts road-alert notifications as ongoing navigation-category car notifications, and removes the dependency on Google Maps notification detection before alert notifications can appear.

Android Auto and the head unit own final notification presentation. The app intentionally avoids `MediaBrowserService`, `MediaSession`, and `CarAppService` entries because opening those surfaces can promote the app into a large split-screen pane.

The APK no longer contains Android Auto media-browser metadata or the fallback `CarAppService` class.

Google Maps route geometry is not exposed to third-party apps. When notification access is granted, `MapsNavigationListener` detects active Google Maps navigation notifications, starts monitoring if enabled, and `AlertMonitorService` posts native road-alert notifications around the live device position.

During movement, remote providers are queried with a wider cache radius than the visible radius. Cached alerts are re-filtered on every location update, and provider-successful refreshes expire missing alerts quickly so Android Auto and the phone UI show only current in-radius alerts while the app keeps nearby upcoming alerts ready without another network refresh. Distance and direction are recalculated from live location updates, and phone labels are updated in place to avoid distracting full-screen refreshes while driving.

## Release

Release tags use `v<versionName>`. The current debug release asset should be named:

```text
TrafficAlertsNotifier-debug-v0.9.33.apk
```
